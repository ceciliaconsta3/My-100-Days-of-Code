### Day 43: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advice from those who have gone ahead before me and SASS tutorial

**Thoughts**: Made minor tweaks to many previous projects. Checked out Dev Material SASS for beginners tutorial

### Day 42: October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Checked in with Codelandia, started wireframing new project, and modified CSS on FCC portfolio page

**Thoughts**: Did a bit of research looking into what programming language I'd like to look start learning and narrowed it down between C# (ASP.NET, Unity) and Java (Android Studio, coursework). The basic syntax between both languages is quite similar and they both are widely used as far as industry standards go. In the end, the final decision may boil down to whichever language I can get the most exposure to, which at this point, may be Java. Also, took a peek into SCSS/LESS and Angular/React to round out my front-end knowledge.

### Day 41: October 4 , 2017

**Today's Progress**: Modified JavaScript and completed pen

**Thoughts**: Added some additional elements to the pen including a button page refresh and dynamically changing text upon <code>drop</code> event completion.

### Day 40: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Jquery UI/Mobile framework and hackathon workshop

**Thoughts**: Went in feeling like I would do well because the workshop classes were covering HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery. Having spent 3 hours on the Broward College campus I realized that most of the students would be actually building apps using Java and Android Studio! Excited and super nervous to see how I can contribute to the presentation portion of my team's project. Inspired to look ahead at some Software I coursework.

### Day 39 : September 27-28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Modified CSS and used HTML Drag/Drop API

**Thoughts**: Nice using some of Javascripts built-in elements. Had a hiccup getting the drag target <code>div</code> to center align with the rest of the elements on the page.

### Day 38: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Used HTML5,CSS3, and JavaScript to create a 2D image using the Canvas API 

**Thoughts**: Spent last few days prepping for the CIW Advanced HTML5 and CSS specialist certification/ final exam. I'd like to be more hands on and consistent with this challenge. Here's a thought; rather than working on unrelated code or tutorials, why not study course material <strong>WHILE</strong>  completing side projects/coding challenges?

### Day 37: September 18-19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated CSS

**Thoughts**: Spent the last few days completing coursework and reviewing a few of the Javascript exercises so I can jump back to where I left off in FCC.

### September 7-17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: On hold - Preparing, experiencing, and recouping from Hurricane Irma



### Day 36: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Modified CSS

**Thoughts**: Received one piece of feedback for the web calculator and that is to implement keyboard shortcuts. Will spend some time researching what that would entail. Falls in line with my thoughts on including accessibility in future projects.

### Day 35: Sept 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Modified CSS and created live link to previous project

**Thoughts**: Spent the last few days away to focus on passing the A+ 220-902 exam for course credit! Used [Codepen](http://codepen.io) so that all of my repositories have a live link attached. If I get more free time I'd like to clone this project using the knowledge I now possess rather than googling every aspect in order to finish it for a course deadline.

### Day 34: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Using the <code>Random</code> function

**Thoughts**: Did an hour in <em>Sams Teach Yourself jQuery and JavaScript in 24 hours</em> and suprisingly the first lesson touched on the random method I was itching to find yesterday. Created a simple pen.

**Link to work:**
* [Roaming Color Changing Button](https://codepen.io/ceciliaconsta3/full/prxQKX/)


### Day 33: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced creating loops

**Thoughts**: Getting some supplemental instruction through Codecademy today. Slowly getting comfortable with looping through arrays.

**Link to work:**
* [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ceciliaconsta3/full/Ojovbw/)



### Day 32: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Submitted first Pull Request (PR)

**Thoughts**: Submitted changes based on an open maintenance issue I enthusiastically offered to address. My task was simply to update license documentation in dependency files. As small as the changes were, I'm happy to be able to make some contribution to a project I've been watching over the last few months. I hope that the reviewers of my PR can find the commits useful.

### Day 31: August 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Used a <code>for</code> loop to look up properties in an array

**Thoughts**: This one really kicked my butt and I'm glad it did. Taking a moment to review what I've been exposed to in the last 5-10 exercises and analyzing what the question is really asking for is a welcome challenge.

### (Reboot) Day 30: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: Had a bit of trouble with this one. In theory, just by looking at how the <code>for</code>loops are set up, I feel I can easily explain the logic aloud, following along like I'm reading a book. The challenge would be in recreating the solution, when there's no tutorial to remind me first, solely based on the question. Going to need a bit more practice with that one. Visited my local library (got a library card and everything, #srsbsnss) and scouped up "Sams Teach Yourself jQuery and JavaScript in 24 hours". Between FCC, my own fresh new copy of "A Smarter way to Learn JavaScript", and Code Newbie's #JavaScript channel, I'm excited to see how much of this language I can master.

### Day 29: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Invited to what could potentially be my first PR on an open-source project.

**Thoughts**: I've been stalking the issue section of potree for some internship related work project. I had given up on hoping my issue/query would be addressed by anyone and decided to see if I could help answer some other issues while I wait. Lo and behold, I got an answer! Martin was gracious enough to not only address my issue but reply back to the email I sent with a ton of great technical posting feedback. His advice is invaluable and now I'm more aware of how much context and how concise I need to be when requesting online assistance. He also taught me about using color coding in a regular textarea:

<pre>
``` javascript
for (var i = 0; i < contact.length; i++){
return "No such contact";
```
</pre>
The grave accent is a technique used to display color coding in code making it more readible when posting it online, an essential trait in every post requesting assistance. Note to self: the easier it is to read, the easier it is to answer.

### Day 28: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I attended the first Free Code Camp Boca Raton group meeting.

**Thoughts**: After much soul searching, I've decided to continue this challenge from where I left off. The members part of the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Kallaway/100DaysOfCode) channel were an incredibly positive, understanding, and encouraging part in this, helping me to pull myself out of the muck. On another note, finally meeting up with local FCC members I've kept in contact with on social media, was a rewarding experience. Inspiring to see people of different levels coming together to code and learn together. I asked questions and got answers. I got asked questions and was able to provide solid input. Love it, exactly why I'm pursuing a career in software development.

### Day 27: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated CSS and added PHP email handling

**Thoughts**: Took a few days off all other extracurricular activities to deal with work issues, school deadlines, and car trouble. Taking a break from the Javascript courses as well after reading an interesting article about perfectionism in learning web development. It mentioned that it's a common occurence in women and career changers (wow double whammy) to hold off finishing a project in order to keep updating or adding new features. Alternatively, a better approach would be to create multiple little one page projects showcasing the thing and then creating a normal sized project showcasing those little things you were practicing.



### Day 26: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to manipulate objects

**Thoughts**: Definitely feel like the learning curve on JS is slowing getting steeper.Had to go back to the [introduction to object lookup](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/using-objects-for-lookups) example to remind myself how to capture the lookups result. Definitely need to add some time for drilling, making sure I cement in this lovely knowledge.

### Day 25: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Using if/else if/else and switches in JavaScript

**Thoughts**: The last exercise made me do a double take when I inserted <code>breaks;</code> into my switch and they were flagged by the editor. I'm glad it did because it caused me to take a better look at how I was counting <code>card</code> (see increment operators on left side :laughing: that's how careful I was being). This was the first time I got all the way up to Hint #3, but it was important to see that I didn't have to count the cards and test the parameters all within my switch (which was what I was trying to do in my first attempt). Though the code could have been more elegant, I'm satisfied that I got it done. Feeling great, like I just solved my first real logic based mini-challenge!

### Day 24: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through FCC exercises

**Thoughts**: Topics of the day were manipulating arrays and queue's and operators

### Day 23 : July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the array exercises on FCC

**Thoughts**: Yesterday I woke up bright and early and returned home positively exhaused, so no homework no coding nothing. :worried: Fortunately, today I got to work through more exercises in FCC!

**Link to work:** [Updated FCC Activity Grid](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ceciliaconsta3)



### Day 22 : July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Javascript module of the FCC curriculum

**Thoughts**: Add animations to the header text of the Portfolio project. I committed the changes and refreshed my browser but noticed that hte project is not rendering the sample on github.io as it is locally. It definitely has something to do with the relevant linking issues users have been commenting on when using github pages. For now, decided to take a break and jump into Javascript module in FCC to see if I can learn enough to implement the sticky navigation onscroll changes I have in mind. Though I've found several example projects online, none of them seemed to work correctly within my one page site. Rather than copy/pasting away, I think it would be more educational to go ahead and learn more about the fundamentals of Javascript before grinding away on that feature.

### Day 21: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some CSS animations and corrected minor issues

**Thoughts**: Practiced a few transition styles, and decided to stick with a simple fade for the Portfolio page project. Eager to apply what I'm learning from the FCC JS section to my projects. For now, soaking it all in and drilling the exercises.

**Link to work:** [FCC Portfolio Page](https://ceciliaconsta3.github.io)



### Day 20: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fiddled a bit with the FCC Portfolio page JS and then started the FCC JavaScript unit.

**Thoughts**: Halfway through copy/paste and chill, switched over to FCC to complete about 25 JavaScript fundamental exercises. Needed a change of pace since I've been getting frustrated with finding the right set of classes to apply the sticky header rules to on the Portfolio page project. On another note, completely bewildered with the Kiosk project and trying to sucessfully add an event to a dynamically loaded navigation toolbar on a dynamically loaded page. :grimacing: :tea: Great time to grasp JS/JQuery if any.

**Link to work:** [FCC Javascript Course began](https://www.freecodecamp.com/ceciliaconsta3)



### Day 19: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created alternate class to be called by sticky header function 

**Thoughts**: Took a step back from the functionality behind sticky headers to actually modify the alternative CSS itself. Wondering if I should make the files live while they're under construction or wait until the finished product is ready. There's a saying going around that goes something like "ship often, fail fast." Meanwhile, the kiosk project is underway again. Next item on the list to learn is how to bind events to dynamically generated HTML pages using JS/JQuery.



### Day 18: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated CSS 

**Thoughts**: Briefly dissecting sticky header tutorials 

**Reference**: [Codepen Example](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qEemdp)



### Day 17: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a github.io page to host my FCC projects currently sitting in Codepen.io. 

**Thoughts**: Decided to create a github.io page for host my FCC projects and such. Heard its all the rage

**Link to work:** [New for live project viewing](https://ceciliaconsta3.github.io)



### Day 16: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Bootstrap html bones for portfolio page, tweaked layout, toned down some ideas
**Thoughts**: Exhausted



### Day 15: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on wireframe for FCC Portfolio project, researched, and created template 

**Thoughts**: It's true what they say; confidence is built on small victories



### Day 14: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just a few more iterative tweaks and voila! FCC Tribute page has been completed

**Thoughts**:  Thrilled that I took my own advice and in doing so, eliminated needless stress. Though the final product is a bit simple and static, I know it's just one step towards a polished future.

**Link to work:** [Tribute Page](https://s.codepen.io/ceciliaconsta3/debug/weVvBd/DqADdEQGnxoA)



### Day 13: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added CSS to the tribute page

**Thoughts**: Hectic last few days with family, coursework, work, tutorials, and errands. Re-evaluated my schedule and recommitting myself to the challenge. Seriously. Plan to finish the tribute page project on the next day of coding.



### Day 12: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created wireframe and HTML/Bootstrap template for new Tribute page

**Thoughts**: Took a deep breath and decided to rollback the scope of the project in favor of exercising my grasp on the fundamentals, implementing KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid). As a result, even without the images and other UI elements, the page is already looking better.



### Day 11: July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated CSS, posted loader to Codepen.io, and changed layout of Tribute page

**Thoughts**: Was requested by a member of the Twitter community to see the linear gradient that I worked on yesterday. I obliged and tweaked what I coded so it looks much more presentable. Noticed that I spend a lot of time iterating through and refactoring my CSS. A solution: incorporate more time into the brainstorming/planning stage. It's pretty cool to get a reply on one of my code related tweets. Reminds me that I'm not the only beginner out there. Lastly, due to time constraints, decided to scrap the slider on the Tribute page in favor of a traditional hero image. Must learn to crawl before walking.



### Day 10: July 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tribute page

**Thoughts**: Decided to fully utilize bootstrap for the FCC Tribute page project. My second time using a carousel slider went much faster this time around. Looking into the documentation to understand exactly what's the function of each class.



### Day 9: July 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CSS Loaders

**Thoughts**: Creating a loader was surprisingly simple and allowed me to practice keyframes and making linear-gradients. Next time around, I'd like to create a full page loader with text (i.e. the kind you get when you look yourself up on one of those suspicious yellow-page sites that tell you they're running a report before they tell you that report cost money). Also, had an issue with turning some directories into submodules. Viewed and removed the hidden git files, recommitted, and pushed it all. That didn't do the trick, but deleting and re-uploading the repository worked fine.

* [Simple loader](https://codepen.io/ceciliaconsta3/pen/MoLwBW)



### Day 8: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Page redirect using JavaScript

**Thoughts**: Kept having issues with the splash page not recognizing the scripts added in main.js. After sifting through Stack Overflow,jsfiddles, Developer tools,and a JS validator and after correcting any relative linking discrepancies, I realized that the issue most likely involved scope. The page couldn't access the method inside the code block. I troubleshooted by triple checking syntax, refactoring my own code, and putting the script directly onto the page to see if it truely was a scope issue. I'm left with a working product and much fewer lines of JS.

### Day 7: July 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Happy Fourth of July! Fixed CSS, organized current projects, and removed irrelevant or broken code

**Thoughts**: Decided to go through and clean up my code in a few projects with information I've gleamed. At the time I had about 14 repositories open. Seemed a bit munch and I googled what my peers opinions are on this and found a good answer in the link below. Consequently, I realized the quote generator wasn't working! Goes to show how important it is to revisit older projects.

* [Multiple or Few repositories](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/206668/using-multiple-git-repositories-instead-of-a-single-one-containing-many-apps-fro3)



### Day 6: July 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JQuery exercises in FCC, moved unecessary comments into Task Lists in multiple projects

**Thoughts**: After some quick research I think a better way to keep track of pending TODO items in a project, aside from code comments, stickies, or Outlook tasks, is creating a TODO or Task List in the ReadMe.md like such:<br>
<pre>
### Task List / TODO
- [ ] App needs to do this
- [x] Finished!
</pre>

**Link(s) to work**:
* [JQuery](https://www.freecodecamp.com/ceciliaconsta3)



### Day 5: July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Swapped out navigation images and Task List

**Thoughts**: Not much time to code today

* [NCT Commits](https://github.com/ceciliaconsta3/NCT/commits?author=ceciliaconsta3&since=2017-07-02T04:00:00Z&until=2017-07-03T04:00:00Z)

### Day 4: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Bootstrap, fixed CSS, added Task List, and cleaned up NCT project file system

**Thoughts**: Rather than using media queries for every screen size, decided to utilize the different column size options already integrated within Bootstrap, revisiting media queries at project completion for final responsiveness check



### Day 3: June 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated My Academy project with some of the CSS knowledge picked up during FCC exercises and best practice links from yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I introduced some Javascript to the landing page. Have an issue with displaying my Bootstrap alert using JS/Jquery. Noticed that sometimes the page refreshes without displaying the alert after clicking submit, while at other times the alert makes a brief appearance. My goal is just to create some sort of follow up action for the users that submit an email, without using PHP or creating a database to hold their data. I'll revisit this once I learn more about forms and finish a few more JS exercises.

### Day 2: June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the remaining 18 exercises in the HTML/CSS portion of the Front End Development Certificate (FEDC). Subsequently researched  HTML/CSS/JS/PHP best practice reference material.

**Thoughts**: Adding negative margins to an element popped up in one of the FCC exercises, funny I discovered that's a thing just earlier this week at work!

From what I understand and to simplify my findings, we use negative margins when you want to bring one element into the space of another. 

<strong>Use case #1:</strong> You enter in additional text the div will expand – to prevent that use negative margin on heading – make value same as the padding inside the div. [Here's an example.](http://css-101.org/negative-margin/index.php)
    <pre>
    In IE6, styling static elements with negative margin may clip them. The fix for this bug is to use position:relative.
    </pre>

<strong>Use case #2:</strong> If you set all margin values to  a negative value, <pre>margin: -15px;</pre> your element will fill that container. [FCC reference] (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/add-a-negative-margin-to-an-element)

### Day 1: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Since it's been awhile since I first began the Front End Developer Certificate curriculum in Free Code Camp, I decided to pick u from the beginning, redoing some of the basics and completing the exercises I missed the first time around.

**Thoughts**: Though I'd prematurely run through the Bootstrap section, looking forward to reviewing the CSS portion of the track. My goal is to become undeniably proficient at CSS. I also noticed how comfortable I felt reviewing the older exercises. A good indicator I've grasped those basics (easy peasy).

Example #2
### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
