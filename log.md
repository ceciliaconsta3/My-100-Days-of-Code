# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Since it's been awhile since I first began the Front End Developer Certificate curriculum in Free Code Camp, I decided to pick u from the beginning, redoing some of the basics and completing the exercises I missed the first time around.

**Thoughts**: Though I'd prematurely run through the Bootstrap section, looking forward to reviewing the CSS portion of the track. My goal is to become undeniably proficient at CSS. I also noticed how comfortable I felt reviewing the older exercises. A good indicator I've grasped those basics (easy peasy).

### Day 2: June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the remaining 18 exercises in the HTML/CSS portion of the Front End Development Certificate (FEDC). Subsequently researched  HTML/CSS/JS/PHP best practice reference material.

**Thoughts**: Adding negative margins to an element popped up in one of the FCC exercises, funny I discovered that's a thing just earlier this week at work!

From what I understand and to simplify my findings, we use negative margins when you want to bring one element into the space of another. 

<strong>Use case #1:</strong> You enter in additional text the div will expand – to prevent that use negative margin on heading – make value same as the padding inside the div. [Here's an example.](http://css-101.org/negative-margin/index.php)
    <pre>
    In IE6, styling static elements with negative margin may clip them. The fix for this bug is to use position:relative.
    </pre>

<strong>Use case #2:</strong> If you set all margin values to  a negative value, <pre>margin: -15px;</pre> your element will fill that container. [FCC reference] (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/add-a-negative-margin-to-an-element)

### Day 3: June 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated My Academy project with some of the CSS knowledge picked up during FCC exercises and best practice links from yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I introduced some Javascript to the landing page. Have an issue with displaying my Bootstrap alert using JS/Jquery. Noticed that sometimes the page refreshes without displaying the alert after clicking submit, while at other times the alert makes a brief appearance. My goal is just to create some sort of follow up action for the users that submit an email, without using PHP or creating a database to hold their data. I'll revisit this once I learn more about forms and finish a few more JS exercises.

### Day 4: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed HTML and some CSS, research some layouts for quote generator.

**Thoughts**: Learned a nice fix for vertically aligning that works with Bootstrap:<br>
<code>
min-height:100vh <br>
display:flex; <br>
align-items: center; <br>
</code><br>
The viewport units are not available across all browsers so a fallback would be to use percentages or pixels. The browser will stop and use whichever is last so a good rule of thumb would be to place the unit you are positive would work above the viewport units.

<!--**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
