# #100DaysOfCodeChallenge: Round 1: Day 74

#### After reading a few Medium posts and getting exposed to the FCC community I've decided to join this challenge for a number of reasons, but mainly to accomplish the following:
* To help me keep myself accountable
* Improve my comfortability with using git as version control
* Increase my knowledge in basic web technologies and best practices
* Create and develop my own personal brand

Follow my Progress through [Codepen](https://codepen.io/ceciliaconsta), [GitHub](https://github.com/ceciliaconsta3/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ceciliaconsta3). Feedback is always welcome and if you're just getting started as well, feel free to join me on this journey :wink:

## Specs

For every day I code outside of work, I will post, update, and share a repo of what I did that day.
Since I'm still new to web and software development, the only exceptions to direct coding days would be those spent learning through online tutorials such as the FreeCodeCampâ€™s Front End Curriculum, Codecademy, etc. The goal is to progress in sound practical knowledge and skills, not breezing through the curriculum for bragging rights. During these days, I'll share a few code snippets or link to some awesome resource I found either in the log or on Twitter.
